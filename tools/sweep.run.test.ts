 * The question this sweep is currently asking.
 *
 * **Edit `ARMS` and run `npm run sweep`.** This file is the question; `sweep.ts`
 * is the machinery, and there is no reason to touch it. It does not run with
 * the ordinary suite -- it plays hundreds of whole games -- so it lives behind
 * its own config.
 *
 * The rules that are not negotiable, and that `runSweep` enforces:
 *
 * - **At least two arms, and they must really differ.** Emulate a control by
 *   moving a constant, never by stashing the source: `git stash push --
 *   <paths>` rejects the entire pathspec when any one path is untracked, so a
 *   control arm that stashes `src/` next to a new file stashes nothing and runs
 *   the new code twice. Section 59.
 * - **Two seed sets.** One to tune against, one to decide with. Section 19's
 *   numbers reversed between them.
 *
 * The arms below are whatever is being asked right now. Replace them.

 * answer.
