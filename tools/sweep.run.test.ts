 * The question this sweep is currently asking.
 *
 * **Edit `ARMS` and run `npm run sweep`.** This file is the question; `sweep.ts`
 * is the machinery, and there is no reason to touch it. It does not run with
 * the ordinary suite -- it plays hundreds of whole games -- so it lives behind
 * its own config.
 *
 * The rules that are not negotiable, and that `runSweep` enforces:
 *
 * - **At least two arms, and they must really differ.** Emulate a control by
 *   moving a constant, never by stashing the source: `git stash push --
 *   <paths>` rejects the entire pathspec when any one path is untracked, so a
 *   control arm that stashes `src/` next to a new file stashes nothing and runs
 *   the new code twice. Section 59.
 * - **Two seed sets.** One to tune against, one to decide with. Section 19's
 *   numbers reversed between them.
 *
 * The arms below are whatever is being asked right now. Replace them.

  // arm is the stated balance target; the two-sided arm is what that split was

  // finally matches the shipped game.
  //
  // **Pairable, which a worldgen lever would not be.** The Hivekin arrive long
  // after the map is made, and their three specials are a separate lever left on
  // in both arms, so the two arms play the same world. The harness checks the
  // map signature and will say so if that is ever wrong -- which is how section
  // 94's confident, meaningless result got caught.
